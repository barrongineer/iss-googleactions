# International Space Station Google Actions

This web service provides a webhook for Actions on Google for integration with Google Home or the Google Assistant on Android. Its primary function is to verbally return the current location of the International Space Station along with a image preview and a google maps link.

The app is being reviewed by Google before publishing, but here are some screen shots of the test version running on a Pixel 2.
